stuff we will need:
1-6 random number generator
those numbers get pushed into an array until player "holds" or rolls a 1 (turn array)
after player holds, those points are added to main score. unless 1 is rolled then nothing is stored into main score (score array x 2)
first to 100 points wins

stuff that would be cool to have:
img of dice thats rolled
option to play the computer

Describe: dice(), roll dice

Test: "it should create a random number between 1 through 6
code: on button click
expected outcome:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
